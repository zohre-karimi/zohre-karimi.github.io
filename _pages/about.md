I am a robotics PhD student at [UofU](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). My passion lies in robotics, particularly in the **surgical robotics** field. My research focuses on robot learning and reward inference from human inputs. In particular, I've worked on improving the robot's performance by learning the policy from suboptimal demonstrations. I earned my bachelor's degree from the [AUT](https://me.aut.ac.ir/en) in Iran, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. During this time, I discovered my interest in robotics and programming. This exposure shaped my decision to pursue further studies in this field.

Part of my role at university was being a **Teaching Assistant** for the **Computer Problem Solving** course.

Also, I like hiking and camping. The fun fact is that they will give me relaxing moments that sometimes help me find the solution for my problem or the bug in my code.
