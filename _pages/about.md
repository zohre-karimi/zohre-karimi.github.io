I am a robotics PhD student at [uofu](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) specializing in **surgical robotics**. My research focuses on robot learning and reward inference from human inputs. In particular, I've worked on improving the robot's performance by learning the policy from suboptimal demonstrations. 

Part of my role at university was being a **Teaching Assistant** for the **Computer Problem Solving** course.

Also, I like hiking and camping. The fun fact is that they will give me relaxing moments that sometimes help me find the solution for my problem or the bug in my code.
