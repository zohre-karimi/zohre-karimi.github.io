I am a robotics PhD student at [uofu](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) specializing in **surgical robotics**. My research focuses on robot learning and reward inference from human inputs. In particular, I've worked on improving the robot performance by learning the policy from suboptimal demonstrations. 

Part of my role at university was being a **Teaching Assistant** for the **Computer Problem Solving** course.

Also, I like hicking and camping. The fun fact is that they will give me the relaxing moments that sometimes help me to find out the solution for my problem or the bug of my code.
